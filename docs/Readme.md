To get the download apk file you must first scan the QR code on the A4 poster.

The QR code will then take you to a static website on github pages where you can download the application.

Once youve loaded into the application you then scan the marker QR code to spawn the marker game object.

Once it has been spawned in you can then use the interaction features there are 4 buttons.

2 of the buttons are rotating buttons, 1 of which rotates the marker left and the other rotates it right.

Another button plays festive music when pressed.

And the final button changes the theme of the application and simulates a snow fall effect across the screen.
